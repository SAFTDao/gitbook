# SAFTDao: Simplifying the creation, execution and operational management of SAFTs

## Abstract

SAFT (Simple agreement for future tokens) have taken hold in the web3 world, however these are still expensive and blah blah TODO: Flesh out problem.\
\
Standardised contracts provide part of the solution, smart contracts which encode the operational management another. SAFTDao puts forward both a coherent set of legal contracts, each with an associated smart contract factory deployed and a DApp to reduce the marginal cost associated with both signing and managing SAFTs.
